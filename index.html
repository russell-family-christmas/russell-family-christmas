        Many precious memories have accumulated this year, from nature walks and
        book reading to welcoming our newest additionâ€”William, born June 10th.
        We feel very grateful for friends and family who have blessed our lives
        with their love and presence. We've been served immensely throughout
        Kaylene's pregnancy and since William's birth. Thank you for all your
        help, love, and support!
        <br /><br />
        Wishing you a peaceful and pleasant Christmas season.
