        This year has been one of growth, learning, and cherished moments.
        Kaylene spent much of the year nurturing baby William, who joined us on
        June 10th. Between caring for him and recovering from pregnancy, she's
        found time to dive into sewing projects and enjoy her love of
        reading.<br /><br />
        Mike continues working at BAE Systems. He's also enjoyed taking the kids
        outside, setting up backyard obstacle courses, and occasionally writing
        poetry, reading, and learning new words.
        <br /><br />
        Ella (5) has made great progress in homeschoolingâ€”learning to read,
        honing her drawing skills, and mastering pull-ups after weeks of
        diligent practice. She also loves her dance class and is becoming a
        great dancer. <br /><br />
        Michael (3) enjoys playing outside, especially getting dirty in the
        yard, and has a vivid imagination that keeps him entertained for hours
        with just a few toys. He and Ella also love playing together whenever
        they can. <br /><br />
        William (6 months) is growing fast and learning how to crawl, keeping
        all of us on our toes.<br /><br />
        We feel grateful for the love and support of friends and family this
        year. <br /><br />
        Wishing you a peaceful and pleasant Christmas season.
